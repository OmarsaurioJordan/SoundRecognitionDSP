# SoundRecognitionDSP

A sound recognition with DMNN (neural network), made in Python + Qt

This is a project for a DSP college class, it is a Qt GUI that receive audios to train a neural network and next can detect if a new audio is similar to one of the train ones. For example, the software listen a youtubers voice, train and next detect if other audio is abou that youtuber.

This is educative, so more than the power of the resulting tool, utility or using of great libraries... it only works like an example of DSP system, showing how audio detection works.

In the data include audios to test, some are great in results others poor. All this was made in 2020 with Python 3... by Omwekiatl.
